# Investment Calculator

A simple investment calculator built with **Angular 21** to practice core Angular fundamentals and clean component structure.

## What this project covers
- Standalone components
- Feature-based folder organization
- Template-driven forms (`ngModel`, `ngSubmit`)
- Parent–child communication using `@Input` and `@Output`
- Business logic encapsulated in services with dependency injection
- Presentation formatting using built-in pipes (e.g. `currency`)
- **HTML fundamentals**: semantic markup, forms, tables, accessibility-aware structure
- **CSS fundamentals**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, responsive design, custom theming using CSS variables, focus states, and minimal component styling

## Notes
- The focus is on correct Angular patterns, not feature completeness
- Styling is intentionally minimal and custom
